Math Problems 

This is a simple JavaScript program that generates a math problem and four possible answers, one of which is correct. The player chooses their answer and the game keeps track of how many answers they got correct. Each game is ten questions long. The challenging part of this one was figuring out the best way to generate reasonable wrong answers so the correct answer wasn't always too obvious. 

This project was created using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
